<p>
This app will ignore the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, as it does not use HTTP to connect to the database.

<p>
Both the <b>run query</b> and <b>update database</b> actions support passing in variables
along with a matching format string (the only valid format descriptor will be "%s").
This can be beneficial to prevent injection attacks.
As an example for the <b>run query</b> action, you could set the <b>query</b> to
<b>select * from found_ips where ipv4_val = %s;</b>, and the <b>format_vars</b> to
<b>8.8.8.8</b>. Parameters should be a comma seperated list to match the formatted string.
